## Following along in the demo / labs
Access to an Azure tenant is required to follow along, as is access to a GCP and AWS Tenant. Not all of these will be free, although the costs should be minimal. 

### Labs
We recommend going through the labs from Part 1 first, as they explain how to setup the various required tenants:
- [Part 1 Labs](http://aka.ms/securingmvc-repo)

Additionally, the demos will go through connecting AWS and GCP to MDC, as per these Microsoft documentation pages:
- [Connecting AWS to MDC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws)
- [Connecting GCP to MDC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-gcp)
- [Connecting non-Azure virtual machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-machines?pivots=azure-arc)

Finally, Azure Arc is a very broad topic. [Azure Arc Jumpstart](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/) has labs for a wide range of scenarios and is recommended to learn more, hands-on.
